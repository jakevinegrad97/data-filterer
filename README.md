The features which you must implement have been prototyped in the class com.connectgroup.DataFilterer. You must implement the
features in this class without changing the signatures of any methods or add any new maven dependencies. You must also provide
evidence that the features you have implemented work correctly.

The time allotted to the test is 1 hour. Your solution will be judged on a number of criteria pertinent to good
software development practice. Incomplete solutions are acceptable.
